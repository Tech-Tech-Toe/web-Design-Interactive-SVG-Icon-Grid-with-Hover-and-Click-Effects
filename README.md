# Interactive SVG Icon Grid

## Overview

This project demonstrates a dynamic SVG icon grid with interactive hover and click effects. The grid features five SVG icons aligned in a row. When you hover over an icon, all previous icons change color, and when you click an icon, it toggles its color while affecting the previous icons.

## Features

- **Hover Effect:** Icons change color on hover, creating a visually engaging effect.
- **Click Effect:** Clicking an icon toggles its color and affects the previous icons.
- **Center-Aligned Layout:** Icons are aligned in the center of the page for a clean, organized look.
